# Tpot Azure SIEM Project

## Overview

Deployed a **TPOT multi-honeypot** on an **Azure VM running Ubuntu** to attract real-world cyber attacks. By integrating **Microsoft Sentinel** as my SIEM, I ingested live Syslog data and built custom **KQL detection rules** to identify SSH brute-force patterns. The project resulted in **360,000+ captured attacks**, **295 automated security alerts**, and key insights into attacker behavior — all while demonstrating hands-on skills in **cloud security, threat detection, and log analysis**.
